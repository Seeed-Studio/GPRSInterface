## GPRSInterface


* **GPRS(General packet radio service)**, is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's global system for mobile communications (GSM).<br> 
* the **GPRSInterface** is a library to use GPRS like Ethernet or WiFi, you can have a try with a GPRS module(ex. [Seeed_GPRS_Sheild](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/GPRS_Shield_V3.0/))<br>

### Usage:
The folowing we will introduce some function which is used very normal. 
#### Initialization
At the very beginning, we should had it initialized. You can use this function :
 
    GPRSInterface gprs(PIN_TX,PIN_RX,19200,"cmnet",NULL,NULL)
    gprs.init();

**PIN_TX** and **PIN_RX** is the serial communication pin with GPRS module<br>
**19200** is the baud rate of serial communication<br>
**"cmnet"** is the [APN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Point_Name) for GPRS service<br>
the first **NULL** is the user name for APN<br>
the second **NULL** is the password for APN <br>

#### Connect the Internet

you can connect the Internet as the following : 

    gprs.connect();

#### Get IP Address

GPRS will get IP address by using **DHCP**, if connect success, you can get the IP address as following :

    gprs.getIPAddress();

#### Send/Recv Data

you can create a TCPSocketConnection instance to send/receive data now :

    TCPSocketConnection sock;
    sock.connect(HOST, PORT);
    sock.send(DATA,LENGTH);
    sock.receive(BUFFER,LENGTH);

#### CLOSE Socket

    sock.close();

#### Disconnect

    gprs.disconnect();
